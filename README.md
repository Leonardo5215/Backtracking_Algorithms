# Backtracking_Algorithms
It's a little showcase of my journey through learning python, in this case the Backtracking algorithms.  It's fun way to solve some problems using brute force and a pretty good learning stone. BT like its name suggest it backtrack in its own steps and kepp trying until it finds a valid solution, like I said before it's a brute force aproach. 

In this repository we can find Three BT problem solver:

*Combination_algorithm: This was the first one of the BT problems and was the one to help me understand how it work and based on that apply it in other issues. This is a simple algorithm that with a given number string gives you the all the unique combinations possibles.

*Knight_Jorney : In this you could imagine an 8x8 chess board and the most unique piece in chess "the knight" which can only move in a "L" shape. The porpouse of this algorithms is to know, from a starting point, the order of steps needed to cover all the titles in the board only once!!. This was the most fun project of these ones.  

*Sudoku_solver: This is easier to image, you introduce a solvable sudoku problem and this algorithm provides you with an answer. For me this was the most difficult algorithm because I had to find a way to validate that the input was valid by the sudoku rules. 

All of the programs have its own notes, thank you for reading.
